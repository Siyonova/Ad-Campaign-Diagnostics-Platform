# AI Ad Campaign Diagnostics & Troubleshooting Platform

An AI-powered platform for diagnosing advertising campaign issues and providing automated troubleshooting suggestions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This project simulates how ad-tech support systems help advertisers diagnose problems in campaign performance data.

---

## Overview

The system analyzes advertising campaign metrics, detects common issues such as low CTR or exhausted budgets, and provides AI-generated troubleshooting explanations using a RAG pipeline.

Users can explore campaign diagnostics through a dashboard and ask natural language questions about campaign issues.

---

## Features

- Campaign diagnostics engine
- Automated issue detection
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector search using FAISS
- LLM-powered troubleshooting assistant
- Interactive dashboard
- Support ticket simulation
- Campaign analytics visualization

## How It Works

1. Campaign data is generated using synthetic datasets.
2. The diagnostics engine analyzes campaign metrics.
3. Issues are converted into vector embeddings.
4. FAISS retrieves the most relevant issues.
5. A language model generates troubleshooting guidance.
6. Users interact with the system via a Streamlit dashboard.

## Example Query

User question:


Why did my campaign stop running?


AI response:


The campaign may have stopped running because the daily budget has been exhausted.
Increasing the campaign budget or adjusting bidding strategy can help resume delivery.
